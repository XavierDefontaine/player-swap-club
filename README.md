# Player Swap Club

A platform for likeminded players to swap games with each other through an automated matching via wishlists and by user location / current market pricings.

## About the Project

I will be discovering the world of serverless on this project through AWS services (Lambdas, DynamoDb etc), consume APIs such as RAWG's, and deliver the front end via React.
